# Managing Educators & Learners

As a Loka Creator, you manage the people in your school -- both the educators who teach and the learners who study.

## Adding Educators

Each educator in your school requires an **Educator Seat** ($6/month per seat). Your Loka Creator plan includes one educator seat by default.

To add a new educator:

1. Go to **Users > Manage LP** in the admin sidebar.
2. Click **Add New Teacher**.
3. Enter their name, email address, and any initial settings.
4. The educator will receive an invitation email with a link to set up their account.

Once activated, the educator gets their own dashboard with access to:

- Lesson scheduling and The Living Textbook
- AI-powered lesson tools (ARP generation, assessment, feedback)
- Student management for their assigned learners
- Canvas and whiteboard tools

### Removing Educators

To remove an educator:

1. Go to **Users > Manage LP** in the admin sidebar.
2. Click on the educator's name.
3. You can cancel their seat subscription or delete their account.

Cancelling a seat subscription stops the monthly billing. Deleting an educator removes their user account. Lesson records from past sessions are preserved in the system.

## Managing Learner Accounts

Learners join your school through an invitation or sign-up link.

### Inviting Learners

1. Go to **Users > Manage Learners** in the admin sidebar.
2. Click **Add Learner**.
3. Enter the learner's details (name, email, etc.).
4. The learner receives an email with instructions to create their account.

### Learner Seats

Each active learner requires a **Learner Seat** ($6/month). Unlike educator seats, learner seats are renewed automatically when the learner pays for lessons. If a learner stops booking lessons, their seat subscription is not renewed.

This means you do not need to manually cancel learner seats -- they wind down naturally when a learner becomes inactive.

### Viewing Learner Details

From the learner management page, you can view:

- Profile information and contact details
- Lesson history and upcoming bookings
- Progress data and current level
- Seat subscription status
- Credit balance

## User Status

Users have a simple active/inactive status:

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **Active** (status = 1) | The user can log in and use the platform |
| **Inactive** (status = 0) | The user account is deactivated |

Active status is required alongside an active seat subscription for full platform access.

## Onboarding

When a new educator is added, they receive a welcome email with login instructions. They can then:

1. Log in with the credentials provided
2. Complete their profile (name, timezone, teaching details)
3. Begin using the educator dashboard once their seat subscription is active

Learners who register through the booking page complete their profile during the registration process.
