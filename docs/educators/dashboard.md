# Dashboard Overview

The educator dashboard is your command center in Loka. From here you can launch lessons, manage students, track earnings, and access all your teaching tools.

## Dashboard Tabs

Your dashboard is organized into three main tabs:

### Earnings (Management)

The **Earnings** tab provides an overview of the business side of your teaching:

- Total earnings and daily average for the selected period
- Top 5 services chart (by booking count)
- Top 5 students chart (by earnings)
- Date range filtering (last 30, 60, or 90 days, or custom range)

### The Living Textbook (Canvas)

The **Living Textbook** tab is where your lessons come to life. This is your gateway to the [Living Canvas](/educators/canvas). From here you can:

- View upcoming and past sessions with quick actions (Start Session / View Session)
- Start a new session with a student (requires an active subscription)
- Review past session canvases
- Access saved notes, keywords, and Active Recall Pairs (ARPs)
- Export canvases as PDF or MP3

### Search (Keywords)

The **Search** tab lets you search and review keywords and vocabulary across all sessions.

## Key Metrics

The Earnings tab displays metrics for the selected period:

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Total Earnings** | Gross revenue from completed lessons |
| **Daily Average** | Average daily earnings for the period |
| **Duration** | Total teaching hours logged |
| **Top Services** | Most popular lesson types by booking count |
| **Top Students** | Highest-value students by earnings |
