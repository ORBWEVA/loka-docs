# Earnings & Payments

Loka tracks your teaching revenue and makes it easy to understand your earnings. View summaries, drill into details, and configure how you get paid.

## Viewing Your Earnings

Navigate to the **Management** tab on your dashboard to access your earnings overview. You'll find:

### Earnings Summary

A high-level view of your revenue for the selected period:

- **Total earnings** -- gross revenue from all completed lessons
- **Daily average** -- your average daily earnings for the period
- **Duration** -- total teaching hours logged

Use the date range picker to view earnings for any period -- this week, this month, a custom range, or all time.

### Top Services

See which lesson types are most popular:

- Service name
- Number of bookings per service
- Displayed as a pie chart showing booking distribution

### Top Students

View your highest-value students by:

- Total revenue generated per student
- Displayed as a pie chart showing earnings distribution

## Earnings by Date Range

Filter your earnings data to analyze specific periods:

| View | Use Case |
|------|----------|
| **This week** | Quick check on current week's activity |
| **This month** | Monthly revenue tracking |
| **Custom range** | Compare specific periods or prepare tax reports |
| **All time** | Full history since you joined Loka |

## Payout Configuration

Loka supports multiple payout methods so you can receive your earnings in the way that works best for you.

### Stripe Connect

Loka uses **Stripe Connect** for direct payouts:

Stripe Connected Accounts can be set up for direct payouts. This is typically configured by your school administrator. Once connected, lesson payments can flow to your Stripe account.

### PayPal

PayPal payouts can be configured by your school administrator for periodic transfers.

### Wise (TransferWise)

For international educators, **Wise** offers competitive exchange rates:

Your Wise email can be configured in your Profile page settings. Wise transfers offer competitive exchange rates for international educators.

:::tip
If you teach students across multiple countries, Wise typically offers the best exchange rates and lowest fees for international transfers.

## Loka Creator Subscription

To use Loka's teaching tools (Living Canvas, session management, AI features), you need an active **Loka Creator** subscription:

| Plan | Monthly Price | What's Included |
|------|---------------|-----------------|
| **Free Trial** | Free for 14 days | 1 Educator Seat + 1 Learner Test Seat (no credit card required) |
| **Loka Creator DIY** | $6/month | 1 Educator Seat + 1 Learner Test Seat |
| **Loka Creator DFY** | $29/month | Everything in DIY + Done-For-You configuration + 2hrs tech support |
| **Loka Creator Aspire** | $199/month | Everything in DFY + 2hrs founder-led coaching |

### Additional Seats

- **Educator Seat**: $6/month per seat -- for additional teachers in your school
- **Learner Seat**: $6/month per student -- renewed automatically with lesson payments

## Understanding the Billing Model

| Seat Type | How It's Billed | Auto-Cancel? |
|-----------|-----------------|--------------|
| **Educator Seat** | Monthly Stripe subscription | No -- requires manual cancellation |
| **Learner Seat** | Renewed when learner pays for lessons | Yes -- stops when lessons stop |

This means your costs scale with your active student base. If a student takes a break, their seat cost pauses automatically.

## Tax and Reporting

Loka provides earnings data to help with tax reporting:

- View your earnings history filtered by date range from the Earnings tab
- Use the 30/60/90 day presets or set a custom date range to match your tax period
- For bulk data exports, contact your school administrator

Loka does not withhold taxes or provide tax advice. Consult with a tax professional about your obligations as an independent educator.
