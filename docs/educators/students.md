# Managing Students

Loka gives you a view of learners who book and attend sessions at your school.

## How Learners Join Your School

### Booking Link

The primary way learners join is through your school's booking page:

1. Share your booking page URL with prospective students
2. They visit the page, browse available services and time slots
3. They create a Loka account (or log in)
4. They book their first lesson and complete payment
5. The learner is automatically added to your school

### Admin Panel

Loka Creators can add learners through the admin panel under **Users > Manage Learners**. The learner receives a welcome email with instructions to set up their account.

## Learner Seats

Each active student requires a **Learner Seat** subscription:

- A Learner Seat costs $6/month per student
- The seat is renewed automatically when the learner pays for lessons
- If a student stops booking lessons, their seat subscription stops as well
- Students without an active seat cannot book new lessons

:::note
Learner Seats are tied to lesson payments -- you do not need to manually manage them. When a student books and pays, their seat stays active. When they stop, it naturally expires.

## Viewing Student Data

### Session History

From the Living Textbook tab on your dashboard, you can review past sessions with each student. Each session includes:

- Canvas notes and content
- Keywords and vocabulary captured
- Active Recall Pairs (ARPs)
- Correction pairs
- Tasks assigned

### Booking Information

Session entries show:

- Lesson date, time, and duration
- Service type
- Earnings from the session
- Session status (booked, completed, cancelled, no-show)

## Reviewing Progress

Use the student's canvas history and ARP library to assess progress:

- Look at correction trends -- are they making fewer errors over time?
- Review keywords -- what vocabulary have they been learning?
- Check session frequency -- are they booking regularly?
