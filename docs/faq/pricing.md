# Pricing & Billing FAQ

Common questions about Loka's pricing, billing, and subscriptions.

---

### What does Loka cost?

Loka uses a seat-based pricing model. The **Loka Creator DIY** plan starts at **$6/month** and includes 1 educator seat and 1 learner test seat. Higher-tier plans (DFY at $29/month, Aspire at $199/month) include additional support and coaching. Each additional educator or learner seat costs **$6/month**.

---

### Is there a free trial?

Yes! Loka offers a **14-day free trial** with no credit card required. You get 1 educator seat and 1 learner test seat with full access to all platform features. After the trial ends, you can upgrade to a paid plan to continue. See [Create Your Free Trial Account](/getting-started/free-trial) for details.

---

### How does learner seat billing work?

Learner seats cost $6/month each, but they are renewed automatically when the learner pays for lessons. If a learner stops booking and paying for lessons, their seat is not renewed. This means you never pay for inactive learners -- seats scale with your active student base.

---

### How does educator seat billing work?

Educator seats are standard monthly subscriptions at $6/month each. Unlike learner seats, educator seats do not auto-cancel. You need to manually remove an educator seat when it is no longer needed. The cancellation takes effect at the end of the current billing period.

---

### Can I change my plan?

Yes. Contact the Loka team to arrange a plan change. Changes can be coordinated to take effect at the start of your next billing cycle.

---

### How do I cancel my subscription?

Go to **Billing** from your profile dropdown and click **Cancel Subscription**. This sends a cancellation request. Your access continues until the end of the current billing period.

Cancelling your Creator plan will deactivate all educator and learner accounts associated with your school.

---

### Can I get a refund?

If you are within the first 14 days of a paid plan, you may be eligible for a refund. Beyond that, cancellations take effect at the end of the current billing period. [Contact us](https://lokalingo.com/en/contact) if you have questions about your specific situation.

---

### What payment methods are accepted?

Loka processes all payments through Stripe. You can pay with any major credit or debit card (Visa, Mastercard, American Express, etc.). Additional payment methods may be available depending on your region.
