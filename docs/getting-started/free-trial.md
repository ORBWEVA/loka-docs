# Create Your Free Trial Account

Getting started with Loka takes less than two minutes. Your free trial gives you full access to the platform so you can explore everything before committing to a plan.

## How to Sign Up

1. Go to [thelivingtextbook.lokalingo.com/start-free](https://thelivingtextbook.lokalingo.com/start-free)
2. Enter your school or business name, email address, password, and timezone
3. You are automatically logged in and taken to your Canvas view

That is it. No credit card required, no sales call, no setup fee.

## What Is Included

Your 14-day free trial includes:

- **1 Educator Seat** -- Full access to the educator dashboard, session tools, scheduling, and the Living Canvas
- **1 Learner Test Seat** -- A test learner account so you can experience the platform from both sides
- **All core features:**
  - Create and manage sessions
  - Use the Living Canvas during lessons
  - Set up your availability and booking page
  - Access the Living Textbook (auto-generated learner notes)
  - Configure AI features (bring your own Anthropic, OpenAI, or OpenRouter API key)
  - View analytics and session history

:::info No Restrictions During Trial
The trial is not a limited demo. You get access to the same features available on the paid DIY plan. The only limitation is time -- 14 days.
:::

## What Happens When the Trial Ends

When your 14-day trial expires:

- **Your data is preserved.** Sessions, learner records, Canvas history, and settings are all kept intact.
- **Active features are paused.** You will not be able to start new sessions or access the Canvas until you upgrade.
- **You can upgrade at any time.** Pick a plan and your account is reactivated immediately with all your data right where you left it.

:::warning Don't Lose Momentum
We recommend deciding on a plan before day 14 so there is no interruption to your teaching. See [Upgrading Your Plan](./upgrading) for details on each option.

## Inviting a Test Learner

During your trial, you can invite a real learner or use the included test seat to simulate the learner experience:

1. Your trial includes a pre-created test learner account
2. Use the test learner to simulate the booking and session flow
3. To add a real learner, share your school's booking page URL -- they can register and book from there
4. Once they book, they appear in your learner list

This is the best way to see the full booking and session flow before going live with real students.
