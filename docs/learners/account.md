# Account Settings

Manage your profile and preferences from the **Profile** page in your dashboard.

## Profile Information

Your profile contains the basic information used in your account. You can update:

- **First name and last name** -- the name shown to your teachers and in lesson records.
- **Email address** -- displayed on your profile but cannot be changed after registration. Contact your school administrator if you need to update your email.
- **Phone number** -- your contact number (required).
- **Address and location** -- your city, country, and postal code.
- **Language** -- your preferred language for the platform.

## Timezone Settings

Loka displays all lesson times in your local timezone. Setting this correctly is important to avoid booking confusion.

- Set your timezone from the dropdown on your Profile page.
- All booking confirmations, reminders, and calendar entries will use your selected timezone.

:::caution
If your lesson times look wrong, the most common cause is an incorrect timezone setting. Double-check this before contacting support.

## Password Changes

To change your password, update the password fields on your Profile page:

1. Enter your new password.
2. Confirm the new password.
3. Click **Save** or **Update**.

If you have forgotten your password, use the **Forgot Password** link on the login page. A reset link will be sent to your registered email address.

## Notifications

Loka sends email notifications automatically for key events:

- Booking confirmations when you book or cancel a lesson
- Lesson reminders before upcoming sessions
- Password reset emails when requested

These notifications are sent automatically and cannot be individually toggled on or off.

:::tip
Make sure your timezone is set correctly so that reminder times make sense for your local schedule.
