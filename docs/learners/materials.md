# Lesson Materials & Recordings

After every lesson, Loka gives you a one-page summary of everything covered. Think of it as your personal textbook that grows with every session.

## Your One-Page Lesson Summary

Each completed lesson generates a summary page -- called a **Canvas** -- that captures what happened during the session. It includes:

### Canvas Notes
Your teacher's notes from the lesson, covering key discussion points, explanations, and anything written on the whiteboard during the session.

### Keywords & Vocabulary
New words and phrases introduced during the lesson, captured as searchable tags for easy review.

### ARPs (Active Recall Pairs)
AI-generated question-and-answer pairs based on the lesson content. ARPs help you practice what you learned by testing your recall of key vocabulary, grammar, and concepts from the session.

### Correction Pairs
Corrections from the lesson, showing what you said alongside the improved version. Each correction pair highlights the specific grammar, vocabulary, or pronunciation point so you understand *why* the correction was made.

### Tasks
Any homework or follow-up tasks your teacher assigned.

## Accessing Materials After Lessons

All your lesson materials are available from your dashboard. Lessons are displayed one at a time with navigation buttons to move between sessions (previous/next).

- **Navigate by session** -- use the prev/next buttons to move through your lesson history.
- **Search by keyword** -- use the Keywords section to search for specific vocabulary across all past lessons.

Materials are available after your teacher completes the lesson summary.

## PDF Downloads

You can download any lesson summary as a PDF for offline study or printing.

1. Open the lesson summary from **My Lessons**.
2. Click the **Download PDF** button.
3. The PDF includes all canvas notes, keywords, ARPs, correction pairs, and tasks in a clean, printable format.

PDFs are useful for reviewing on the go or sharing with study partners.

## MP3 Audio

Loka can generate an MP3 audio file of your lesson content, powered by text-to-speech. This is helpful for:

- **Listening practice** -- hear correct pronunciation of keywords and phrases.
- **Review on the go** -- listen to lesson summaries during your commute or workout.
- **Reinforcement** -- hearing the material in addition to reading it strengthens retention.

To generate an MP3:

1. Open the lesson summary.
2. Click the **MP3** button.
3. The audio file will be generated and available for download or streaming.

:::tip
Revisit your lesson summaries regularly. Spaced repetition -- reviewing material at increasing intervals -- is one of the most effective ways to move knowledge into long-term memory.
