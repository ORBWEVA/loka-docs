# Progress Tracking

Loka helps you see how far you have come and what to focus on next. Your progress is tracked automatically as you complete lessons, tasks, and assessments.

## Level System

Your language level is assigned by your educator and follows a structured progression. Levels are typically aligned with frameworks like CEFR (A1 through C2) or your school's custom level system.

Your current level is visible on your dashboard and determines:

- The difficulty of AI-generated review materials (ARPs).
- Suggested vocabulary and grammar points.
- Placement in group lessons, if applicable.

As you progress, your educator can update your level to reflect your growth. Level changes are logged so you can look back and see your journey.

## Session History

Your dashboard keeps a complete record of every lesson you have completed. For each session, you can review:

- **Canvas notes** -- your teacher's notes from the lesson, including key discussion points and whiteboard content.
- **Keywords & vocabulary** -- new words and phrases introduced during the session, with definitions and examples.
- **CIPs (Correct & Incorrect Phrases)** -- corrections from the lesson, showing what you said alongside the improved version.
- **ARPs (Active Recall Pairs)** -- AI-generated review pairs to test your recall of lesson content.
- **Tasks** -- any homework or follow-up activities assigned by your teacher.

See [Lesson Materials & Recordings](/learners/materials) for more detail on accessing and downloading your session content.

## Credits

Credits are used to book lessons on Loka. Your learner seat is active as long as you are booking and paying for lessons. When you pay for a lesson, your seat is automatically renewed for the billing period.

You can view your lesson history and upcoming bookings from your dashboard.

Review your lesson materials regularly. Revisiting Canvas notes and practising ARPs between sessions is one of the most effective ways to retain what you have learned.
