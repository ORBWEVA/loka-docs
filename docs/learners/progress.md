# Progress Tracking

Loka helps you see how far you have come and what to focus on next. Your progress is tracked automatically as you complete lessons, tasks, and assessments.

## Level System

Your language level is assigned by your educator and follows a structured progression. Levels are typically aligned with frameworks like CEFR (A1 through C2) or your school's custom level system.

Your current level is visible on your dashboard and determines:

- The difficulty of AI-generated review materials (ARPs).
- Suggested vocabulary and grammar points.
- Placement in group lessons, if applicable.

As you progress, your educator can update your level to reflect your growth.

## Structured Curriculum Levels

Some schools use Loka's structured curriculum feature, which organizes learning into defined stages. Each level has a description and assessment criteria that your educator uses to evaluate your progress. When your educator determines you are ready, they can advance you to the next level.

## Reward Points

Some schools award reward points when you book lessons. Points accumulate over time and are displayed on your dashboard alongside your credit balance. The specific reward structure depends on how your school has configured their services.

## Credits

Credits are the currency you use to book lessons in Loka. Depending on your school's setup:

- **Credit-based booking** -- each lesson costs a certain number of credits. You purchase or receive credit packs, and credits are deducted when you book.
- **Subscription-based booking** -- your plan includes a set number of lessons per period. Credits may still be used for extra lessons beyond your plan limit.

You can view your credit balance on your dashboard.

## Badges

Badges recognize specific achievements and milestones. Examples include:

- **First Steps** -- completed your first session on Loka.
- **Dedicated Learner** -- completed 5, 10, 25, 50, or 100 sessions.
- **On a Roll** -- maintained a 3-day session streak.
- **Week Warrior** -- maintained a 7-day session streak.
- **Monthly Master** -- maintained a 30-day session streak.

Earned badges appear on your profile and dashboard. They are a fun way to see your accomplishments at a glance.
